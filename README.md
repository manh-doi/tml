# TML - a parser for LL(1) language

TML is a Python-based LL(1) lexer and parser library.
It is a robust and flexible tool designed specifically for creating custom domain-specific languages (DSLs).
With its linear time complexity (O(n)), the framework ensures rapid parsing performance, even for large codebases.

## Key Features

* Highly Customizable:
    * Define grammars intuitively using a user-friendly API.
    * Tailor the lexer and parser to meet specific language requirements.
    * Extend the framework with advanced features like preprocessors and postprocessors.
* High Performance:
    * Optimized LL(1) parsing algorithm for maximum performance.
    * Linear time complexity (O(n)) guarantees fast parsing speeds.
* Accurate Error Reporting:
    * Detailed syntax and lexical error reporting down to the character level, facilitating efficient debugging.
* User-Friendly:
    * Intuitive API and comprehensive documentation for easy learning and use.
    * Strong support for integration with other tools and libraries.

## Benefits

* Accelerated Development: Significantly reduce the time and effort required to build a new language, allowing
  developers to focus on language semantics.
* Highly Customized Languages: Create languages tailored to specific project requirements with unparalleled flexibility.
* Improved Code Quality: Detailed error reporting enables rapid detection and correction of errors, ensuring
  high-quality code.

## Why Choose Our Framework

* Python-Based: Leverage the power and popularity of the Python programming language.
* Open Source: Open-source codebase enabling community contributions and development.

## Use Cases

* Build DSLs for Specialized Domains: Create specialized languages for domains such as data science, graphics, or
  embedded systems.
* Develop Tools and Libraries: Use the framework to build tools and libraries that support software development.
* Language Research: Experiment with new language concepts and structures.
